# Build Scripts

A couple of scripts I wrote in powershell to make compilation easier. Best with the text editor [4Coder](http://4coder.net/).
There's an OpenGL version with glfw and glad.

## Usage:
### builder.ps1:
Run it, you'll be prompted for **source name** either put filename.c or filename.cpp and in the executable name put, executable_name.exe

### opengl_builder.ps1
Run it, you'll be prompted for glad link, generate it by going to http://glad.dav1d.de/ (will prolly make this simpler in the near future). And the rest is as same as builder.ps1. 
		p.s. You won't have to setup anything, just double click and run.


	Might make one for SDL or any other library I use in the near future.
